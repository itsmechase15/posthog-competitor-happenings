# How this bot writes

Every string this bot posts is PostHog copy, so it follows the handbook. These
two pages are the standing constraints, and they win over anything here:

- [Docs style guide](https://posthog.com/handbook/wizard-and-docs/docs-style-guide)
- [Tone of voice](https://posthog.com/handbook/brand/tone)

What that means for a Slack alert, which is short and read at a glance:

- Write like a smart friend explaining what happened, not a company trying to
  impress. Clear beats clever.
- Address the reader as "you". Active voice, present tense, concise.
  Contractions are fine.
- No em dash. When a line needs a dash, it is an en dash with a space either
  side: `PostHog experiments stop manually – there is no end time`. A hyphen is
  not a dash.
- Oxford comma, American English spelling, straight quotes and apostrophes.
- No "simply", "just", "easily", "obviously", "of course", or "clearly".
- No hedging: helps you to, empowers, enables you to unlock, leverage,
  streamline, robust, best-in-class, holistic, seamless, synergy.
- Simple words. Use, not utilize. Explain jargon or drop it.
- No emojis in prose. The impact dot is a label, not prose, so it stays.

## Where this is enforced

- [`src/analysis/prompt.ts`](../src/analysis/prompt.ts) states the rules to the
  model, with both handbook URLs, so the copy is right when it is written.
- `sanitizeCopy` in [`src/util/text.ts`](../src/util/text.ts) rewrites em
  dashes as spaced en dashes and curly quotes as straight ones. It runs over
  every model string in `normalizeAnalysis`, and again over every Slack text
  node on the way out, so a model slip cannot ship.
- Tests in [`test/slack.test.ts`](../test/slack.test.ts) and
  [`test/analysis.test.ts`](../test/analysis.test.ts) assert the punctuation of
  the rendered message.

The prompt and the sanitizer are the two places to change when the handbook
changes.
